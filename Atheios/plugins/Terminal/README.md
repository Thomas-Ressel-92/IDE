# Terminal Emulator

This plugin allows for interaction with the unix terminal through the [Atheos](http://www.atheos.io) IDE.

# Installation

Please utilize the Atheos Marketplace for installation. In order to manually install, unzip the repository into your plugins direcotry and ensure the folder is named "Terminal".

Simply open the terminal via it's entry in the right-hand menu. The default password is `terminal` which can be changed in `/emulator/term.php` in the `define('PASSWORD','terminal');`.

After successfully logging into Atheos, one can open the emulator.php file in their browser directly to have the terminal inside another window.
